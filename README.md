Thanks to the people of the [Reactor](https://reactor.gg) discord server for helping me decompile the game to get indexes. Seriously appreciated, this project would be majorly unfinished without you.

Really, massive thanks to EnbyCosmog for not only dumping <i>*all*</i> of the IDs but manually transcribing all of the in-game names as well. Seriously; how could you possibly be cooler than that?

## Licensing

Some components of this project may seem appealing to use in your own. Go ahead! You're not legally entitled to support though. Also some of the contributors (specificaly for `data_indexes.py`) would probably appreciate credit, but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯.
